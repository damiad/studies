# Studies Repository

This repository contains code that was written during the study of computer science at the University of Warsaw. The code is organized into directories based on academic years, and within each year, there are subdirectories for individual subjects. Each subject directory contains separate folders for different assignments, and each assignment folder includes a solution and a README.md file with the assignment description and additional information.

## Directory Structure

The repository follows a hierarchical structure to maintain a systematic organization of the codebase. The top-level directories are named after the respective academic years, allowing for easy navigation and identification of code from specific time periods. Within each year directory, there are subdirectories corresponding to different subjects studied during that year. This subdivision helps in categorizing the codebase based on the subjects.

Furthermore, each assignment within a subject has its own dedicated folder. These assignment folders contain the solution code for the specific task, along with a README.md file. The README.md file provides a detailed description of the assignment, including its requirements, constraints, and any additional instructions or notes.

## Additional Information

Apart from the directory structure, this repository may also include other files or resources related to the study of computer science at the University of Warsaw. These additional files can be helpful in understanding the context, methodologies, or concepts covered during the course of the studies.
