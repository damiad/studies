#### Final Project

The goal of this project is to motivate you to gain a deeper understanding of GAN architecture by analyzing the source code provided in the example presented during the classes. As part of this project, you are asked to complete the tasks listed below. The maximum number of points that can be obtained for each task is indicated in parentheses.

1) Show what needs to be changed in the discriminator to modify the filter size to 4x4. As a solution, present a code snippet with the applied modifications.

2) Show what needs to be changed to remove edge images from the input to the discriminator (the input for the discriminator should only be RGB images without clouds - generated by the generator or real). As a solution, present a code snippet with the applied modifications.

3) Remove the skip connections from the generator and show how it affects the results on the test data. Train two models: the original one and the modified one. Then, run the trained models on the test data. As a result, show how the generator code has changed, present the generated images from both models in a way that allows for visual comparison of the results, and summarize the observed differences in a short description (a few sentences/points).
