# Security Challenge Project 1

## Task Description

The task is to exploit vulnerabilities in a provided web application, locate hidden flags, and report your findings.

### Objective

Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the web application to find three hidden flags. Each flag is in the format `FLAG{some_text}`.

## Task Details

- The challenge is hosted at: [https://web.kazet.cc:42448](https://web.kazet.cc:42448).
- The source code (with flags removed) is available at: [https://web.kazet.cc/static/zad41-mimuw-finals-2023.zip](https://web.kazet.cc/static/zad41-mimuw-finals-2023.zip).

### Flag Information

- There are three flags to find.
- Each flag is worth a maximum of 3 â…“ points, totaling 10 points.

### Deadline and Penalty

- Late submissions will lose 1 point for each started day of delay.

## Submission Requirements

- **Flags**: Submit the text of each flag as proof of task completion.
- **Vulnerability Descriptions**: Provide a detailed explanation of the vulnerabilities discovered and how they were exploited. The explanation should be comprehensive enough for others to understand the solution process.
- **Source Code**: Include the source code for all payloads/scripts used in the exploitation process. Submit these as separate files, not as code blocks within a PDF, for easier testing.

### Recommended Tools

- To write HTTP request scripts, consider using the `requests` library in Python.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Solutions that identify the correct flag will receive full points for that flag.
- Submissions will be evaluated based on the understanding of the task, as demonstrated by the descriptions and scripts provided.

## Getting Started

1. Download the source code from [this link](https://web.kazet.cc/static/zad41-mimuw-finals-2023.zip).
2. Analyze the application to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. Develop and test your exploits to locate the flags.
4. Document your findings and prepare your submission.
