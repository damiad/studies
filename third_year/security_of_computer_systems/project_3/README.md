To provide a solution for the challenge, here's what is needed:

1. **Index Number**: This is your student identification number.
2. **Task Name**: Identify the specific task being solved (e.g., "Hard Challenge" or similar).
3. **Flag**: This is a unique string retrieved from the remote server `bsk.bonus.re:13337` upon successful exploitation.
4. **Exploit Script**: A script that exploits the remote service to gain an interactive shell or print the flag.

Here's a structured approach to solving the challenge:

### 1. Understanding the Challenge
The challenge involves exploiting a remote service hosted at `bsk.bonus.re` on port `13337`. The service interacts with the user by first asking for a student index number and then the difficulty level of the task.

### 2. Development Process
- **Initial Exploration**: Start by connecting to the service manually or through a script to understand its behavior.
- **Exploitation Steps**: Progress from easier to harder tasks, leveraging any learned vulnerabilities or techniques from previous levels.
- **Automation**: Develop a script using a tool like `pwntools` in Python to automate the interaction and exploit the vulnerabilities identified.

### 3. Solution Components
- **solve.py**: The exploit script utilizing `pwntools` to automate the interaction with the remote service.
- **README.md**: Documentation in English detailing:
  - Overview of the challenge and its objectives.
  - Explanation of the chosen exploit strategy.
  - Instructions on how to use `solve.py`.
  - Any significant findings or challenges encountered.
  - Security considerations and ethical implications.

### 4. Key Points to Remember
- **Documentation**: Ensure clear comments and explanations within the code (`solve.py`).
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Attempt to solve each level (easy, medium, hard), building on previous exploits.
- **Socket Handling**: Use appropriate methods (`readuntil`, `readn`) to manage data received from the socket.
- **Ethics**: Respect the terms of service and guidelines provided. Avoid any attempts to disrupt or harm the server.

### 5. Submission
- Submit the required items (index number, task name, exploit flag, and `solve.py` script).
- Partial solutions are also acceptable and will be evaluated accordingly.

This approach ensures a systematic and ethical approach to solving the challenge while documenting the entire process for evaluation purposes.
